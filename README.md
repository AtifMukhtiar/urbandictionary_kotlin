# Urbandictionary Kotlin
This is demo application creating Urban Dictionary.<br>
I have used some of the technologies listed below:<br>
  1- Retrofit for API calls to search dictionary words<br>
  2- MVVM design pattern<br>
  3- Dagger for dependency Injection<br>
  4- RecyclerView to show the data in list<br>
  5- ConstrainLayout for User Interface<br>
